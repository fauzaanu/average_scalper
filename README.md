# Average Scalper ðŸ“ˆ

The **Average Scalper** strategy is a straightforward approach to trading using moving averages and the Average Daily Range (ADR).

## Strategy Overview

This strategy utilizes the **50 Exponential Moving Average (EMA)** to determine buy and sell signals, along with the **ADR** for risk management and profit targeting.

### Buy Signal 

- **Condition:** Initiate a buy when the price is greater than the 50 EMA.
- **Stop Loss:** Set a stop loss at **1x ADR** away.
- **Target:** Aim for a profit of **1/3rd of ADR**.

### Sell Signal

- **Condition:** Initiate a sell when the price is less than the 50 EMA.
- **Stop Loss:** Set a stop loss at **1x ADR** away.
- **Target:** Aim for a profit of **1/3rd of ADR**.

## Rationale

- The stop loss is positioned to accommodate price fluctuations while allowing for a reasonable risk-reward ratio by targeting only 1/3rd of the ADR.
- Following the average trend through the 50 EMA helps align trades with prevailing market conditions.

## Optimizations ðŸ› 

- The idea makes sence to me and is not backtested extensively
- I have kept the options quite open so everyone can switch out the EMA and ADR periods, the SL and TP multipliers as they like.
- The only non-negotiable part for me is the lot size calculation. I have kept lot sizes fully dynamic and based on risk, someone who might prefer fixed lot size can modify the code but this is not something recommended.
